I was following Webassembly tutorial for Rust, for creating Game of Life.

It was such a great tutorial for learning webassembly concepts.
I can imagine a lot of things done in Webassembly, that would improve speed so much.

Build process (for me, to remember):
* `wasmp-pack build`
* `cd www`
* `npm run watch`
